* Data visualization

Learning outcomes:
* Understand the basic concepts of Geographic Information Systems
* Define terms related to raster and vector data models (e.g. pixel, grid, spatial resolution, attribute table, topology)
* Compare vector and raster data models; Understand the difference between geographic and projected coordinate systems
* Select objects using attribute and spatial queries
